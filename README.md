# Cheapest Public Transport to Work

Before COVID, it was generally accepted that people would be in the office from 9-5 Monday-Friday. At the time of
writing (March 2021), people currently work from home. When COVID restrictions relax, it may be the case that people
work from home for some days, and commute to the office for the other days.

There are a variety of public transport options available for commuting: Bus, Train, Tram, or a combination of these.
Each have different ticketing options (day ticket, season ticket, bundles of tickets, etc...).

The task will be to develop an application to plan someone's commute between home and work, and to calculate the
cheapest public transport ticketing for them to buy, taking in to account the number of days on which the user is
expecting to be commuting to work. The app should also present options to the user and allow them to prioritise things
such as time, cost, number of changes, etc...
